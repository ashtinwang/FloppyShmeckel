# FloppyShmeckel

A flappy bird game where the bird is a floppy shmeckel and the pipes are scissors. You are trying to avoid circumcision. Save your foreskin at all costs.

Try to avoid using a graphic image for the shmeckel. A cartoon shmeckel will probably do. You could possibly even use a picture of a jew baby instead of the flying shmeckel itself. Maybe a baby with my face photoshopped on it!



GUY's NOTES.


This is Dean's stupid idea.  Please don't hold me accountable for any of it.  Essentially I have provided you with two scissor sprites and working code that I got from the internet.  All you need to do is add a shmeckel sprite, which needs to be sourced in the project folder.  Everything else works.  Please do not ask me what a shmeckel is.  I don't want to talk about it.  Ask Dean instead.
